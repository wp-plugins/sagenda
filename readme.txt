Sagenda is a free online software that helps your clients fix appointments at absolutely NO COST!

== Description ==
Sagenda is an online booking software that helps your clients fix appointments and meetings with you online. Sagenda is available at absolutely NO COST for you or your clients! And the best thing about it is that you may have an unlimited number of bookings and/or customers. Our users always come first; that’s why Sagenda doesn’t display ads!

This is an “Online Booking System” which gives customers the opportunity to choose the date and the time of an appointment according to one's own preferences and the booking can now be done online.

The Sagenda system can be added to any type of website, so it is not necessary to make a new one. It can be added as a new page or in a new space.
